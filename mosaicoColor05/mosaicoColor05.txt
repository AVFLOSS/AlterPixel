 ** A Processing sketch, to create continuous mosaics of color images **

* The goal is that when you click on an image of the mosaic, it is enlarged and a new mosaic is created with all the images.

* Instructions:
  - Left click = it changes image
  - Mouse wheel = zoom + zoom-
  - Click and drag = when zoomed it pans the image
  - Right click = if zoomed it resets the image to the center
  - z = it takes a photo of the webcam (if there is webcam)

* Bugs:
  - When the image has been zoomed and/or panned the coordenate mouseX and mouseY does not correspond to the tile (cell) clicked.
  - If you click on the black margins, it stops working.
